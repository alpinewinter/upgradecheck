To use, simply list the hostnames of the target devices in the 'hosts' file, one per line. Run the file 'upgradecheck'. The script will run through each device and give you a listing of what IOS version it is running, whether or not it is compliant, and confirms the MD5 hash of the software image. Debug output from the SSH session can be viewed in the /logfiles directory, listed by hostname.
